------ Regarding AirWaveThess and its creators  ------
AirWaveThess is a climate-focused application created for the OpenUP Hackathon Thessaloniki Climate 2025 by Konstantinos Petrakis and Kyriaki Pantsiopoulou. The project was developed using TypeScript, React, Python, and FastAPI.

Kyriaki Pantsiopoulou holds a Bachelor's degree in Applied Informatics from the University of Macedonia and a Master's in Business Administration & Information Systems from Aristotle University Thessaloniki. She is passionate about the creative applications of programming and enjoys exploring the intersection of technology and artistic expression. Her interests include cinema, gaming, and art.

Konstantinos Petrakis graduated from the Computer Science Department at Aristotle University of Thessaloniki. His work focuses on web development, particularly cross-platform solutions that prioritize accessibility and performance. He has a strong interest in scientific computing, especially in data analysis and visual representation. Outside of work, he enjoys programming, gaming, and weightlifting.

------ Regarding Data Sources and Quality Indexes ------
Data Sources

All data is collected from Thessaloniki Data Space, specifically from Thessaloniki Port Authority and Open Knowledge Greece.

Air Quality Index (AQI)

The AQI used is based on the European Air Quality Index (EAQI). The AQI for a location is determined by the highest sub-index among measured pollutants at a given time (maximum operator rule).

AQI Levels:

Good (Dark Blue): Air quality is satisfactory.
Fair (Light Blue): Acceptable, but possible concern for sensitive individuals.
Moderate (Green): Some pollutants may cause health risk.
Poor (Yellow): Health effects may be experienced.
Very Poor (Orange): Increased risk for everyone.
Extremely Poor (Red): Serious health effects likely.
Pollutants and Health Effects:

Ozone (O₃): Formed by reactions between VOCs and NOₓ under sunlight. Can cause breathing difficulties, asthma, reduced lung function, and chronic lung disease.

Index 1: 0–50 μg/m³
Index 2: 50–100
Index 3: 100–130
Index 4: 130–240
Index 5: 240–380
Index 6: 380–800
Nitrogen Dioxide (NO₂): Produced from traffic and combustion. Irritates airways and worsens asthma.

Index 1: 0–40 μg/m³
Index 2: 40–90
Index 3: 90–120
Index 4: 120–210
Index 5: 210–400
Index 6: 400–600
Sulphur Dioxide (SO₂): From burning coal and oil. Causes bronchoconstriction, asthma attacks, and more hospital visits.

Index 1: 0–100 μg/m³
Index 2: 100–200
Index 3: 200–350
Index 4: 350–500
Index 5: 500–750
Index 6: 750–1000
Carbon Monoxide (CO): Odorless gas from incomplete combustion. Reduces oxygen delivery, causing headaches, dizziness, fatigue; high levels can be fatal.

Index 1: 0–4400 μg/m³
Index 2: 4400–9400
AQI Calculation:

Sub-index for each pollutant is calculated by linear interpolation between breakpoints:
Ip = Ilo + ((IhiIlo) × (CpClo)) / (ChiClo)
Ip: sub-index for pollutant
Cp: measured concentration
Clo, Chi: breakpoints enclosing Cp
Ilo, Ihi: index levels for Clo and Chi
Final AQI is the maximum of all sub-indices.
Sea Water Quality Index (WQI)

The WQI is a weighted sum of sub-indices for each parameter, providing an overview of water quality.

WQI Categories:

90–100: Excellent
70–90: Good
50–70: Medium
25–50: Bad
<25: Very Bad
Parameters, Definitions, Weights, Guidelines:

Arsenic (As): Toxic metalloid from industry/natural sources. Weight: 0.1. Guideline: 0.02 mg/L.
Cadmium (Cd): Heavy metal from batteries/coatings. Weight: 0.1. Guideline: 0.055 mg/L.
Copper (Cu): Essential trace, toxic at high levels. Weight: 0.1. Guideline: 0.013 mg/L.
Dissolved Oxygen (%): Oxygen saturation, crucial for marine life. Weight: 0.2. Guideline: 100%.
Lead (Pb): Toxic heavy metal, neurological effects. Weight: 0.1. Guideline: 0.044 mg/L.
Nickel (Ni): Industrial effluent, toxic to aquatic life. Weight: 0.1. Guideline: 0.0 mg/L.
Temperature (°C): Affects oxygen/metabolism. Weight: 0.1. Guideline: Optimal 20°C.
WQI Calculation:

Sub-index for each parameter:
Chemical pollutants: Qi = max(0, 100 × (1Ci/Ti))
Temperature: Q = max(0, 100 × (1|T-20|/10))
Dissolved Oxygen: Q = min(DO%, 100)
Qi: sub-index (0–100), Ci: measured concentration, Ti: guideline
Final WQI:
WQI = 0.2 Q_DO + 0.1 Q_As + 0.1 Q_Cd + 0.1 Q_Temp + 0.1 Q_Cu + 0.1 Q_Pb + 0.1 Q_Ni
